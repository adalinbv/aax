At = 20*log10(Ps/Pr) 	-- dB
Ps: rms sound pressure at the source
Pr: rms sound pressure at distance r from the source

At = As + Aa + Ae	-- dB
As: attenuation due to geometric spreading
Aa: attenuation due to atmospheric absorption
Ae: excess attenuation due to all other effects  
    - Ag: attenuation from the ground in a homogeneous atmosphere 
    - refraction by a non-homogeneous atmosphere
    - attenuation by diffraction and reflection by a barrier or obstacle,
       and scattering or diffraction effects due to turbulence

As = 20*g*log10(r2/r1)	-- dB
g: 0 for plane wave propagation (uniform pipe), 0.5 for cylindrical propagation
   from a line source, and 1 for spherical wave propagation from a point source.
r1, r2: distance r1 and r2 from a source
