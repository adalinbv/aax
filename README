Adalin provides the AeonWave audio engine software under a dual license model
designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial
distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors),
VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute
commercially licensed software with AeonWave software and do not wish to
distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under the
GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license
agreement with Adalin.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:

For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL
that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with AeonWave
open source software licensed under either the GPLv2 or the the GPLv3 is the
best option.
