AeonWave (2.2.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Added flanging effect.
  * Speed-up of filter and effect processing.
  * Added filter and effect support for streaming audio.
  * Added the option to modify the Q factor of frequency filters.
  * Added an 8 band graphical equalizer for the final mixer stage.
  * Added the inverse of the modulation-waveform for filters and effects.
  * Added an envelope following option for filters and effects (auto-wah).
  * Added seamless transisition from tube-like clipping to digital clipping
    and add an asymmetric clipping option. This is most noticeable for
    the distortion effect.
  * Added support for a dedicated configuration file entry for every device.
  * Move the speaker setup from the global section to device specific section
    in the configuration file.
  * Added support for subframes. Subframes are like regular audio-frames
    but they are registered at other audio-frames. Where audio-frames
    render in their own thread, subframes will render in their parents thread.
    This removes any limit to the number of supported emitters as long as the
    system can handle the load.
