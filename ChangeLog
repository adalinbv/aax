- AeonWave (2.3.0) stable; urgency=high
 * Distance-delay mode now adds delayed state changes in addition to delayed
   start/stop. State changes include; pitch, gain, position, orientation and
   velocity.
 * Added sense of height to Surround sound; emitters can now be heard above
   and below the speakers. This is best perceived if the speakers and the
   listeners ears are (almost) in the same horizontal plane.
 * Add support for the AAXS (AeonWave Auto-generated XML Sound) audio format.
 * Add double precision 64-bit floating point matrix support functions.
 * Implement hardware volume support for ALSA and WASAPI.
   - hardware volume is adjusted within hardware boundaries, volume settings
     outside the hardware range are adjusted using software fallback.
   - the volume filter now reports the hardware minimum and maximum.
 * Implement Auto-Gain Control with a user definable adjust-rate.
 * Add the option to select stereo, mono-left, mono-right or mono-mix for
   audio capturing.
 * Add an aaxMixerGetState function to retreive the state of the current
   audio stream. This can for instance be used to reinitialize the device
   after the hardware audio format has changed.
 * Add the option to set the number of times to loop a buffer.
 * Fixed reported bugs.
   - Fix an issue that prevented ALSA from reporting new hardware while an
     application was running.
   - Fix an issue with loopback capturing of the playback stream.
   - Fix an issue with flanging for emitters registered at the final mixer.
   - Fix an issue that affected HRTF and Surround sound playback.

* Fri Mar 08 2013 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.4) stable; urgency=low
 * Add an aaxFree function to free memory allocated by the library.
   This might be necessary when using different compilers.
 * Add support for a Reverb effect which anly applies to the final mixer.
 * Make the dynamic-gain envelope-following mode a proper audio-compressor and
   expander with noise gate. The offset property defines the threshold level.
 * Add the option to retrieve the compression level for every track.
 * Add an aaxAudioFrameGetSetup function to be able to retreive the above.
 * Add the ability to retreive peak and average audio levers for every track
   (final mixer only).
 * Fix distortion behavior, it was overcompressing for high distortion factors.
 * Add an envelope following option for the distortion effect.
 * Remove some dupplicate code, most code is now shared between the mixer and
   audio-(sub)frames which should lead to fewer case specific problems.
 * Fix LFO situations where changing the LFO values could become out of bounds.
 * Fix filters and effects for registered sensors.
 * Overhaul of the Windows backend en threads code.
   - Fix a lot of corner case situations that failed before.
   - Improve runtime performance conciderably.
   - Fix registered sensors.
 * Allow sensors to be registered at subframes.
 * Expose the driver latency.

* Tue Aug 21 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.3) stable; urgency=high
  * Fix a naming clash between ZeroXML and libxml2. The function names of the
    library were inadvertently exposed.
  * Sanitize the slot parameters for Filters and Effects when calling their
    respective SetState function to prevent possible buffer overflows.

* Tue Jul 31 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.2) stable; urgency=medium
  * Fix a delay effects (phasing, chorus, flanging) problem that was introduced
    by the off-by-one fix for streaming audio with a low sample frequency.
  * Fix IMA4 support for WAV file capturing and playback on non file backends.
  * Fix end-of-file problem that could cause a segmentation fault.
  * Fix an off-by-one problem for the loopback device.

* Mon Jul 16 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.1) stable; urgency=low
  * Added native support for Windows (Vista or later).
  * A complete overhaul of the File backend;
    - added file capturing support and support for different output formats.
    - added the infrastructure to detect and handle different audio file-formats
      + WAV files are always supported for input and output.
      + MP3 file (input) is supported if libmpg123 is installed.
  * Fix the default ALSA device for when PulseAudio isn't active.
  * Fix an off by one problem for streaming audio with a low sample frequency
    compared to the mixer frequency.
  * Fix a problem where multiple open backends in the same application could
    not have different rendering types (HRTF/Stereo/Spatial/Surround).
  * Moved the include files aax.h to aax/aax.h and aaxdefs.h to aax/defines.h
    and provide stubs that automatically include the correct header file.
  * Moved the configuration file from ~/.aaxconfig.xml to ~/.aax/config.xml
    and added code that automatically moves the old configuration file to the
    new location if it doesn't yet exist.
  * Made the aaxDriverGetInterface functions more reliable by storing interface
    description for every opened device (as a bonus this also causes less
    kernel audio device detection calls).

* Tue May 01 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Added an 8 band graphical equalizer for the final mixer stage.
  * Added an envelope following option for filters and effects (auto-wah).
  * Added seamless transition from tube-like soft-clipping to sharp-clipping
    and add an asymmetric clipping option. This is most noticeable for
    the distortion effect.
  * Added support for registered sensors. Registering an aaxConfig handle
    which is opened in AAX_MODE_READ mode eliminates the need for the
    application to do buffer handling between the physical input device and
    an emitter. It also improves latency since reading the buffer and
    processing it's contents is done in a single step.
    Registered sensors are only guaranteed in stereo mode for this release.
  * Added support for subframes. Subframes are like regular audio-frames
    but they are registered at other audio-frames. Where audio-frames
    render in their own thread, subframes will render in their parents thread.
  - This removes any limit to the number of supported emitters as long as the
    system can handle the load. The maximum number of registered emitters,
    sensors and subframes per audio frame is still 256.
  * Move the speaker setup from the global section to device specific section
    in the configuration file. This allows for different setups for headphone
    connections and (for example) 4 channel spatialised speaker setup.
  * Added support for a dedicated configuration file entry for every device.
  * Added the inverse of the modulation-waveform for filters and effects.
  * Added the option to modify the Q (resonance) factor of frequency filters.
  * A complete overhaul of the recording code and of the ALSA backend.
  * Fixed filter and effect support for streaming audio.
  * Added a resampling option for fetching buffer data.
  * Speed-up of filter and effect processing.
  * Added flanging effect.
  * Dozens of small fixes.
