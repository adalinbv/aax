- AeonWave (3.0.6) stable; urgency=low
 * Postpone initialization of AAXS filter and effect code for emitters to
   make sure they will be set after initializing the mixer which could change

 * Changed the return types of all filter and effect functions (except for the
   Create functions) for aaxFilter/aaxEffect to match the rest of the API.
   Note: This might require client side code changes.
 * Fixed some lingering header mistakes. This makes version 3.0 binary
   incompatible with earlier version. Recompilig is required.
 * Removed version 1.0 compatibility header files.
 * Renamed the C++ interface() functions to interface_name() since some projects
   undefine 'interface' causing the preprocessor to hide these functions.
 * Make sure that capturing does not stagnate the engine when a (http) stream
   stalls.
 * Fix a bug where modulating waveforms by non-sine waveforms caused silence.
 * Fix a segmentation fault when a particular file extension does not
   support writing.

- AeonWave (2.5.0) stable; urgency=low
 * Added a capabilities interface to detect the limits of the audio hardware
   by making calls to the aaxMixerGetSetup function.
 * Changed the threading model from one thread per mixer-registered audio-frame
   to a load-balancing threadpool model. This slightly increases the work the
   CPU has to do but divides the wall time spent on rendering by the number of
   physical cores. Threading is now always active on multi-core systems except
   when the environment variable AAX_USE_THREADPOOL is set to 0.
 * Add support for the ARM architecture including support for hardware FPU
   and NEON. Rendering performance is comparible with Intel/AMD Cores
   at a matching CPU frequency.
 * Support defining a default output device in the confguration file.
 * Fix a problem when a registered sensor had a different number of
   audio periods in relation to the playback device.
 * Fix an emitter looping bug introduced in version 2.4.1
 * Support URL parsing for the file backend and properly handle HTTP streaming
   (READ mode only).

   after the state is set to AAX_PLAYING.
 * The file backend can now return song meta data.
 * Install to the proper system directory on 64-bit Windows

   The library may now be included in commercial and non commercial projects
   provided the user is made aware of the option to upgrade to the HD version.
   See Copyright section 2.1; Rights and Limitations of Grant.
 * Reorganized the code to support different hardware rendering schemes in
   the future. As a result the current rendering speed has increased 25% to 75%
   (depending of the computer hardware, older hardware profit the most).
 * Add the option to use timer-based rendering instead of interrupt-based
   rendering for ALSA (experimental).
 * Fix a problem where the WASAPI device period could become lower than the 
   minimum allowed period for that particular device.
 * Switched to a new xml configuration file format.

- AeonWave (2.3.0) stable; urgency=high
 * Distance-delay mode now adds delayed state changes in addition to delayed
   start/stop. State changes include; pitch, gain, position, orientation and
   velocity.
 * Added sense of height to Surround sound; emitters can now be heard above
   and below the speakers. This is best perceived if the speakers and the
   listeners ears are (almost) in the same horizontal plane.
 * Add support for the AAXS (AeonWave Auto-generated XML Sound) audio format.
 * Add double precision 64-bit floating point matrix support functions.
 * Implement hardware volume support for ALSA and WASAPI.
   - hardware volume is adjusted within hardware boundaries, volume settings
     outside the hardware range are adjusted using software fall-back.
   - the volume filter now reports the hardware minimum and maximum.
 * Implement Auto-Gain Control with a user definable adjust-rate.
 * Add the option to select stereo, mono-left, mono-right or mono-mix for
   audio capturing.

   - Fix an issue that prevented ALSA from reporting new hardware while an
     application was running.

 * Add the option to retrieve the compression level for every track.
 * Add an aaxAudioFrameGetSetup function to be able to retrieve the above.
 * Add the ability to retrieve peak and average audio levers for every track
   (final mixer only).
 * Fix distortion behavior, it was over compressing for high distortion factors.
 * Add an envelope following option for the distortion effect.

* Mon Jul 16 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.1) stable; urgency=low
  * Added native support for Windows (Vista or later).
  * A complete overhaul of the File backend;
    - added file capturing support and support for different output formats.
    - added the infrastructure to detect and handle different audio file-formats
      + WAV files are always supported for input and output.
      + MP3 file (input) is supported if libmpg123 is installed.
  * Fix the default ALSA device for when PulseAudio isn't active.
  * Fix an off by one problem for streaming audio with a low sample frequency
    compared to the mixer frequency.
  * Fix a problem where multiple open backends in the same application could
    not have different rendering types (HRTF/Stereo/Spatial/Surround).
  * Moved the include files aax.h to aax/aax.h and aaxdefs.h to aax/defines.h
    and provide stubs that automatically include the correct header file.
  * Moved the configuration file from ~/.aaxconfig.xml to ~/.aax/config.xml
    and added code that automatically moves the old configuration file to the
    new location if it doesn't yet exist.
  * Made the aaxDriverGetInterface functions more reliable by storing interface
    description for every opened device (as a bonus this also causes less
    kernel audio device detection calls).

* Tue May 01 2012 - tech@adalin.org
- AeonWave (2.2.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Added an 8 band graphical equalizer for the final mixer stage.
  * Added an envelope following option for filters and effects (auto-wah).
  * Added seamless transition from tube-like soft-clipping to sharp-clipping
    and add an asymmetric clipping option. This is most noticeable for
    the distortion effect.
  * Added support for registered sensors. Registering an aaxConfig handle
    which is opened in AAX_MODE_READ mode eliminates the need for the
    application to do buffer handling between the physical input device and
    an emitter. It also improves latency since reading the buffer and
    processing it's contents is done in a single step.
    Registered sensors are only guaranteed in stereo mode for this release.
  * Added support for subframes. Subframes are like regular audio-frames
    but they are registered at other audio-frames. Where audio-frames
    render in their own thread, subframes will render in their parents thread.
  - This removes any limit to the number of supported emitters as long as the
    system can handle the load. The maximum number of registered emitters,
    sensors and subframes per audio frame is still 256.
  * Move the speaker setup from the global section to device specific section
    in the configuration file. This allows for different setups for headphone
    connections and (for example) 4 channel spatialised speaker setup.
  * Added support for a dedicated configuration file entry for every device.
  * Added the inverse of the modulation-waveform for filters and effects.
  * Added the option to modify the Q (resonance) factor of frequency filters.
  * A complete overhaul of the recording code and of the ALSA backend.
  * Fixed filter and effect support for streaming audio.
  * Added a resampling option for fetching buffer data.
  * Speed-up of filter and effect processing.
  * Added flanging effect.
  * Dozens of small fixes.
