- AeonWave (2.2.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Added an 8 band graphical equalizer for the final mixer stage.
  * Added an envelope following option for filters and effects (auto-wah).
  * Added seamless transition from tube-like soft-clipping to sharp-clipping
    and add an asymmetric clipping option. This is most noticeable for
    the distortion effect.
  * Added support for registered sensors. Registering an aaxConfig handle
    which is opened in AAX_MODE_READ mode eliminates the need for the
    application to do buffer handling between the physical input device and
    an emitter. It also improves latency since reading the buffer and
    processing it's contents is done in a single step.
    Registered sensors are only guaranteed in stereo mode for this release.
  * Added support for subframes. Subframes are like regular audio-frames
    but they are registered at other audio-frames. Where audio-frames
    render in their own thread, subframes will render in their parents thread.
  - This removes any limit to the number of supported emitters as long as the
    system can handle the load. The maximum number of registered emitters,
    sensors and subframes per audio frame is still 256.
  * Move the speaker setup from the global section to device specific section
    in the configuration file. This allows for different setups for headphone
    connections and (for example) 4 channel spatialised speaker setup.
  * Added support for a dedicated configuration file entry for every device.
  * Added the inverse of the modulation-waveform for filters and effects.
  * Added the option to modify the Q (resonance) factor of frequency filters.
  * A complete overhaul of the recording code and of the ALSA backend.
  * Fixed filter and effect support for streaming audio.
  * Added a resampling option for fetching buffer data.
  * Speed-up of filter and effect processing.
  * Added flanging effect.
  * Dozens of small fixes.
