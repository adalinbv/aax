AeonWave (2.2.0) stable; urgency=low
  * Added an 8 band graphical equalizer for the final mixer stage.
  * Added an envelope following option for filters and effects (auto-wah).
  * Added seamless transisition from tube-like soft-clipping to sharp-clipping
    and add an asymmetric clipping option. This is most noticeable for
    the distortion effect.
  * Added support for subframes. Subframes are like regular audio-frames
    but they are registered at other audio-frames. Where audio-frames
    render in their own thread, subframes will render in their parents thread.
  - This removes any limit to the number of supported emitters as long as the
    system can handle the load.
  * Move the speaker setup from the global section to device specific section
    in the configuration file.
  * Added support for a dedicated configuration file entry for every device.
  * Added the inverse of the modulation-waveform for filters and effects.
  * Added the option to modify the Q factor of frequency filters.
  * Added filter and effect support for streaming audio.
  * A complete overhaul of the recording code.
  * Speed-up of filter and effect processing.
  * Fix delay effects for audio-frames.
  * Added flanging effect.
