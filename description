AeonWave is a hardware accelerated, high speed, low power consumption and
versatile stereo and 4D audio mixing library that can handle almost any audio
mixing demands; from studio effect mixing to immersive simulation.

AeonWave combines the demands for stereo mixing and immersive 3d audio rendering
or simulation and gaming in one library. The library adds support for 
audio-frames that can either be used as containers to move around multiple
3d sound emitters with one call or for applying filters or effects to multiple
stereo sources before sending it to the final mixer. A three-band parametric
equalizer is also supported for the final mixing stage.

Stereo filters include Tremolo, Volume Envelope and Frequency filtering.
3D filters include angular and distance filtering.
Stereo effects include Vibrato, Pitch Envelope, Distortion and Chorus.
3D effects support consists of Velocity effect (Doppler).

A built-in waveform generator supports Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth
and Impulse waveforms as well as White, Pink and Brownian Noise. Different
waveforms can be mixed or ringmodulated at different frequencies and mixing
ratio's allowing a wide range of complex waveforms to be generated on-demand.

For audio buffers the library supports 9 native audio formats and a total
of 29 different formats (inclusing signed/unsigned and big/little-endian).
Buffers can be converted from and to any of the supported formats.
