Cross platform, hardware accelerated, multi-channel and 4D capable audio rendering engine
 AeonWave is a hardware accelerated, high speed and low power consumption
 audio library designed for professional studio and simulation solutions.
 It can handle 4D (where 4th dimension is time delay) positional audio and
 multi-channel mixing equally well.

 The separately available OpenAL layer makes the library ready for most of
 the current software while it's native API makes it ready for future audio
 demands.
