A cross platform, hardware accelerated, versatile stereo and 4D audio mixing library.
 AeonWave is a hardware accelerated, high speed, low power consumption and
 versatile stereo and 4D audio mixing library that can handle almost any audio
 mixing demands: from studio effect mixing to immersive simulation.
 .
 AeonWave combines the demands for stereo mixing and immersive 3D audio
 rendering (for simulation and gaming) in one library. In addition to
 registered sensors that adds support for both jack-in audio-capturing as well
 as file-input auto-streaming the software adds support for audio-frames.
 Audio-frames can be used as containers to move multiple inter-connected 3D
 sound emitters aroud the scene with just one function call. Audio-frames can
 also be used or for applying filters or effects to multiple (stereo) sources
 before they get mixed together.
 .
 Stereo filters include Tremolo, Volume Envelope and Frequency filtering.
 3D filters include angular and distance filtering.
 Stereo effects include Vibrato, Pitch Envelope, Distortion, Chorus And Flanging.
 3D effects support consists of Velocity effect (Doppler).
 Either a three-band parametric equalizer or 8-band graphical equalizer can be
 assinged to the final mixing stage.
 .
 A built-in waveform generator supports 5 waveform types and 3 types of noise.
 Different waveforms can be mixed or ringmodulated at different frequencies and
 mixing ratio's allowing a wide range of complex waveforms to be generated
 on-demand.
 .
 For audio buffers the library supports 9 native audio formats and a total of
 29 different formats (inclusing signed/unsigned and big/little-endian).
 Buffers can handle sample-rate conversion and can be converted from and to any
 of the supported formats.
