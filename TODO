Short term projects:
================================================================================
* Indoor sound propagation:
  - Use an audio-frame for each rectangular room section.
    + TODO:
      - Add bounding-box support to audio-frames.
      - Process only mono signals (emitter/audio-frame) when a bounding-box is
        defined.
      - Add support for fast (mono) reveberation to audio-frames, these will
        only filter the sound but not propagate them (make use of the delay
        effects code, eliminate the direct path when not connected to the
        scenery).
      - Only when this mono signal enters the scenery it will be positional,
        based on the audio-frames position.
      - Add the option to somehow link the audio-frame defined filters and
        effects to the scenery. This way the listener can move around in the
        room sections tree too.

  - Use an intersection audio-frame for any overlapping areas:
                                  --------------------------
  Mixer/Scenery - Listener       |          .               |
        |                        |       E' .            E  |
  inter-section audio-frame (E') |.......... ---------------
        |                        |          |
  room section audio-frame       |       L  |
        |                         ----------
     emitter (E)
