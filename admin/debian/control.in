Description: Stereo and 4D Audio eXtensions library
 A hardware accelerated, high speed and versatile stereo and 4D audio mixing
 library that can handle almost any audio mixing demands; from studio effect
 mixing to immersive simulation. 
 .
 AeonWave combines the demands for stereo mixing as wel as immersive 3d audio
 rendering or simulation and gaming in one library. There is support for
 audio-frames that can either be used as containers for moving around multiple
 3d sound emitters or for applying filters or effects to multiple stereo 
 sources before sending it to the final mixer. There is also a three-band
 parametric equalizer for the final mixing stage.
 .
 Stereo filters include Tremolo, Volume Envelope and Frequency filtering.
 3D filters include angular and distance filtering.
 Stereo effects include Vibrato, Pitch Envelope, Distortion and Chorus.
 3D effects support consists of Velocity effect (Doppler).
 .
 A built-in waveform generator that supports Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth
 and Impulse waveforms as well as White, Pink and Brownian Noise. Different
 waveforms can be mixed or ringmodulated at different frequencies and mixing
 ratio's allowing a wide range of complex waveforms to be generated on-demand.
 .
 For audio buffers the library supports 9 native audio formats and a total
 of 29 different formats (inclusing signed/unsigned and big/little-endian).
 Buffers can be converted from and to any of the supported formats.
