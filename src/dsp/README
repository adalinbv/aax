Note:
Filters or effects should not declare memory for themselves but instead should
be relying on _aaxFilterCreateHandle and _aaxEffectCreateHandle to do so.

Adding another slot to filters and effects:
* Increase the third parameter of the call to the _aaxFilterCreateHandle function
  in the _aax[NAME]FilterCreate and _aaxNew[NAME]FilterHandle function.

* Parameter for slots > 0 should be kept in a private data structure and these parameters
  should be assigned in the _aax[NAME]SetState function. Likewise whould the slot[n]
  parameters be set from the strucure in the _aaxNew[NAME]FilterHandle function.

* Do not forget to set the new parameter limit in the _aax[NAME]MinMax structure.
  Min and max are set to 0.0f by default and without altering them in the table
  the parameter will always end up being 0.0f.

* Setting default slot parameters for filters and effects is possible in the
  _aaxSetDefaultFilter2d, _aaxSetDefaultFilter3d, _aaxSetDefaultEffect2d and
  _aaxSetDefaultEffect3d functions in filters.c and effects.c This is only
  useful if the default value is something else than 0.0f, which is the default.
